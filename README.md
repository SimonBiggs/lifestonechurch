* Fork this repository
* Clone it to your computer
* Switch to the `gh-pages` branch
* Run `bundle install`
* Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''`
* Go to `localhost:4000` in your browser
* Now you can edit the site and the site will get generated automatically (but you'll still need to hit refresh in the browser)
