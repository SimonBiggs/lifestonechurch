They were introduced at the wedding of mutual friends and married in 2003. The Musgraves have two children, Sam (11) and Daniel (8).

In their free time, they both enjoy reading and traveling, Lisa enjoys gardening, and Tom enjoys all things automotive and aviation. What they love most about LifeGroups is the opportunity to live in community, to build deeper relationships, to serve each other and serve together and to get to know God better in the setting of a small group. Tom and Lisa welcome new friends and new faces to try out their Lifegroup and look forward to growing God’s church together everyday!"
