        description: "Ben grew up in Chadron, Nebraska and Kristen in Littlefield, Texas. The two met while attending Wayland University and married in 2000. Ben served in various churches as Student Minister for several years before planting and pastoring a church in Weatherford, TX in 2009. Kristen taught Music in public schools and worked alongside Ben as they shared Jesus’ love with hundreds of students and adults. In 2013, Ben and Kristen, along with their children, Rachel (now 12), Karis (10), and Jaxson (7), moved here to Herriman to plant the first ever Bible- teaching church in Herriman! Ben serves Lifestone as Lead Pastor and Kristen serves as Kid’s Life Elementary Coordinator and Worship Team Coordinator. In their spare time, Ben enjoys playing basketball and working on cars, and Kristen enjoys remodeling and singing. What Ben and Kristen love most about LifeGroups is making life-long friends, and they hope that you, too, get connected and build lasting friendships!"

Jerame grew up in a small California town in the middle of Death Valley called Trona.  Jessie ping ponged between Dallas, TX and SLC, UT all her life until meeting Jerame in 2009 on eharmony.  Jerame is a manager at a power plant, likes video games, the NFL Dolphins, and all things redneck.  Jessie home schools their two boys, clowns around for her father’s entertainment company, likes sewing, motorcycles, and all things crunchy.  Jerame serves Lifestone in many ways and his favorite is working the sound board for the worship team.  Jessie serves Lifestone as a greeter and helping with the teens.  The Blevins favorite thing about Lifestone is living life together with people who love them some Jesus!"
