<h2><strong>Kid’s Life</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Check in:</strong> Help us ensure the safety of Lifestone’s kids by working either the nursery or kids check in tables for 20 minutes before the worship service begins</p>
<p><strong>Nursery:</strong> Show Jesus’ love to the babies of Lifestone! No preparation required! Just be ready to cuddle and giggle.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching:</strong> Inspire a life-long love for Jesus in either preschool or elementary -aged students through teaching a one hour lesson that is easy to follow and prepare.</p>
<h2>First Impressions</h2>
<p><strong>Greeting:</strong> Serve the Lord by greeting, smiling, and passing out programs all in an effort to make Lifestone Church known for its warm welcome! We ask greeters to arrive 30 minutes before the worship service begins.</p>
<p><strong>Tour Guide:</strong> Help our guests feel relaxed and confident as they find kid’s areas, worship area, and the cafe.</p>
<p><strong>Cafe:</strong> Help gather and set up food and supplies in our cafe. This is a very important role as we work to make Lifestone as welcoming as possible!</p>
<h2>Set up/ Tear Down</h2>
<p><strong>Set up:</strong> Set up happens on Saturday evenings from 7:00-8:00. Sunday services could not happen without the efforts of this courageous and motley crew! Come help us set up kids areas and the worship area so that when we arrive Sunday mornings, we can spend time in fellowship with God and each other!</p>
<p><strong>Tear down:</strong> This happens immediately following Sunday services and is usually completed in 30 minutes. Help us put away equipment in kids areas and the worship area and leave our beautiful facility better than we found it!</p>
