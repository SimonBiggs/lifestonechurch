## LifeGroup Study Notes

Can you think of a time when a stranger unexpectedly helped you? Tell the story. How did that impact you?

1. Ministry often happens in the interruptions of life. Jesus gave his followers clear instruction and a great example of what it looks like to be interruptible and to meet the needs of others. Read [Mark 10:46-52](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/mark.10) and [Matthew 25:31-46](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/matthew.25) and then answer the following questions.

    What helps you pay attention and take notice of the needs of others?

	 What can distract you from taking notice of these needs?

	 How could you become more interruptible to be used by God?

2. Jesus told a story about a Samaritan man whose offer to help someone in need was far more than a kind gesture. Read the story in [Luke 10:25-37](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/luke.10) and notice what getting involved cost this guy. Can you think of anyone in your life that may need some help from you? What's at risk for you to step in and offer to help? How can we follow the Samaritan's example and see our helping role through to the end?

3. Sometimes we get confused about what it takes or feel inadequate to make a difference in the world around us. What do the following verses reveal about what it really takes to make an impact and how it happens?

    [Matthew 5:16, 20:26](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/matthew.5)

    [Ephesians 2:10, 3:20](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/ephesians.2)

    [1 Timothy 6:17-18](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1ti.6)

    [Titus 3:8](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/titus.3.8)
