## LifeGroup Study Notes

Share a time someone was very generous to you.

Looking back over your sermon notes, was there a particular point, story or scripture that challenged, confused, or caught your attention?

1. This Saturday we saw the critical mistake Ananias and Sapphira made when they tried to impress everyone with their generosity. Obviously, it's not a mistake any of use would want to make - especially knowing what happened to the two of them! Read 1 Timothy 6:6-10 and Matthew 6:25-34 and then jot down what they tell us about the desire to impress people and the pursuit of recognition.

2. Generosity is a natural outflow of the Holy Spirit. Yet, when we talk about generosity, at times there can be confusion about the appropriate motivation behind it and God's view of it. As you read 2 Corinthians 9:6-15, what insights do you gain about generosity, especially its motivation and purpose?

    What are some ways you can be generous besides financially? Is there any area you might sense the Holy Spirit motivation you to be more generous?

3. What guidance does 2 Peter 1:3-9 give us about focusing on developing godly character as a top priority? Is there anything in these verses that you'd like to work on "adding to your faith"?
