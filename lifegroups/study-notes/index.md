Read Acts 4:1-31

- What has upset the religious leaders (v. 1-2)?

- What action did they take (v. 3-7)?

- Just a few weeks have passed since Annas and Caiaphas had been involved in the condemnation of Jesus. In his response to their question "By what power or name did you say this?" Peter is forcing them to encounter Jesus again. What does Peter say about him (v. 10-12)?

- In verses 13-22, what made it so difficult for the opposing religious leaders to bring this unacceptable behavior to a halt?

- What was the reaction of the believers to John and Peter's account (v. 24-30)?

- What does their prayer tell you about their faith in the character, power, and faithfulness of God (v. 24-30)?

- When has your faith been challenged by others?

- Imagine that you had been in a group of believers John and Peter returned to and told of what had happened. What would have been your reaction?

- "After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly." In what ways do you need the power of the Holy Spirit to face the world today?
