## LifeGroup Study Notes

Ice Breaker- What additional language would you like to speak and why?

1. We have heard in this Sunday's teaching that as followers of Christ there will be evidence of the Holy Spirit working in our lives. But have you ever been confused as to what that looks like or how you recognize the work of the Holy Spirit? How does Ephesians 4:17-32 help you answer these questions?

2. Last Sunday we heard that one of the primary purposes of the Holy Spirit is "to make God look good." As you read 1 Corinthians 2:9-15, what other roles does the Holy Spirit play in the lives of those who are committed to following Christ? Have you found this to be true in your life?

3. We all too often get tripped up in thinking that it's just "God and me." We forget that our regular connection with believers is essential to tuning into and being led by the Holy Spirit. How does Hebrews 10:24-25 describe and emphasize this point?

These kinds of connections usually don't happen by accident and often need to be intentional. Are there any steps you need to take to make a better connection with other believers?
