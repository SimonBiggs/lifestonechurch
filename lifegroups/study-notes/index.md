## LifeGroup Study Notes

As LifeGroups come to a close for the Spring semester, we encourage you to stay in God's word this summer. One way to do this is through...

### [rightnow.org](http://www.rightnow.org)

Lifestone Church has purchased everyone who attends our church access to this incredible resource. *It is 100% FREE to YOU!* It contains 10,000+ Bible study videos covering topics on parenting, marriage, finances, defending your faith, books of the Bible, church history, other religions, leadership... just to name a few. It also contains a wonderful section for the kids with videos like "Veggie Tales" and "What's in the Bible" - our current Kid's Life curriculum the kid's LOVE!

To access this amazing resource you should have received an invite from our church via email. If not, just email [Keely](mailto:keely@lifestonechurch.net) and ask for Right Now Media access.

Download the app for easier access. It's available on many media players. It's the "Netflix" for Bible study.
