<blockquote>”For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.” -Romans 6:23 (NLT)</p></blockquote>
<p>You are not an accident.  You are the wonderful creation of God.  He made you to love you.  The ultimate expression of this love is dying on a cross in your place for breaking His law.  Everyone has broken His law and is therefore imperfect.  Because God is perfect, we can not be connected with Him in our imperfection or sin.  The payment for your sin and the sin of the world has been PAID IN FULL by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.  However, God doesn’t force a relationship and this free gift of forgiveness upon anyone.  Instead God offers it freely to those who accept it.  To accept it you simply place your trust in Jesus alone to save you from spiritual death.  You can do this right now through a simple prayer like this:</p>
<p>“God I admit that I have broken Your law.  I have lived life on my own terms.  I accept Your amazing free gift of forgiveness.  Thank you Jesus for paying my penalty.  I now live for You alone.”</p>
<p>This may seem too easy.  You may feel you don’t deserve this kind of gift.  That is why it is AMAZING grace.  Your salvation is not easy.  It was incredibly painful and difficult, but Jesus did it in your place.  A gift requires nothing more than acceptance from the beneficiary.</p>
<p>This is the best decision you will ever make.  Your next step is to share this decision and connect with others who have trusted Jesus in a Bible based Christian church.  Welcome to God’s family.</p>
