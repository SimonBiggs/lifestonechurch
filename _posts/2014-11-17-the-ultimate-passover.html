<h2>LifeGroup Study</h2>
<p>Looking back at your notes from Sunday’s Message, was there anything that particularly caught your attention, challenged or confused you?</p>
<p>1. Can you remember a time in your life when God was working for the good in your life, even though you couldn’t see what he was up to at the time?</p>
<p>2. How has your understanding of Communion changed after this weekend’s sermon?</p>
<p>How will it affect your participation in Communion from now on?</p>
<p>3. God always has a plan even when we can’t clearly see what it is. Occasionally, God “pulls back the curtain” to allow us to see what he’s up to behind the scenes. In Exodus 14, we find the Israelites have just been miraculously liberated from Egypt. They are now camped on the shore of the Red Sea and the Egyptian army is closing in on them. What feelings and thoughts do you see them experiencing in Exodus 14:10-12?</p>
<p>Now look at Exodus 14:1-4, what was happening behind the scenes that the Israelites weren’t aware of?</p>
<p>What has been most helpful to you in maintaining your confidence that God has a plan, even when you can’t see what he’s doing?</p>
<p>4. What was hinted at in Passover is fully revealed in Communion – Jesus Christ is the lamb who died for our sins. His sacrifice made it possible for Christians to experience a whole host of spiritual “benefits.” Read the following verses and write down the spiritual benefit each one talks about.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:7</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:18</p>
<p>Colossians 1:13-14</p>
<p>Romans 5:1</p>
<p>Which one of these is most encouraging to you? Which one are you most likely to overlook?</p>
