## LifeGroup Discussion Questions

If you could live in any time period anywhere- When and where? Why?

Ephesians 1:1-14

1. What names of God do you observe in this passage? This should include names of any individual members of the Trinity.

1. List all of the "spiritual blessings" you see in this passage given by God to believers.

1. List at least 1 observation per section:

    v. 1-3

    v. 4-7

    v. 8-10

    v. 11-14

1. Refer back to the list of "spiritual blessings" mentioned in this passage. What role does each Person of the Trinity (the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit) play in providing us these blessings?

1. What does "redemption" mean (see Romans 8:23; Colossians 1:14; Hebrews 9:25; 11:35)? What did it cost and who paid the cost? What motivated this cost to be paid for us?

1. What does it mean to be "sealed with the Holy Spirit" (1:13)? What must a person do to receive this? How does this sealing relate to our inheritance and redemption?

1. What does Paul mean by "adoption as sons" (see Romans 8:15-17)? How did it occur?

1. God wants the truth of these spiritual blessings to affect our lives. How should these truths...

    ...affect your self-worth or opinion of yourself?

    ...benefit you when you go through hard times or commit sin?
