## LifeGroup Discussion Questions

1. The more time we spend with someone, the better we get to know them. For example, if we listed the character qualities of those closest to us chances are you would be able to think back on your time with them and see how much your understanding of who they are has grown. The same is true in how we grow in knowing God. As you look at the characteristics of God below, which, if any, have you seen grow or change in your own understanding and appreciation of who God is?

    Love, Grace, Forgiveness, Kindness, Justice, Other.

1. Knowing and understanding God's ultimate power in our life and our world makes a big difference in how we live out the hope we have in following him. When we can't see God's power in a situation, we can easily become pessimistic or shortsighted.

    How does 2 Kings 6:8-17 encourage you to remember that God's power is active beyond what we know?

1. Paul's answer to the Ephesians (and us) is that we would know God (Ephesians 1:17-19). How does Proverbs 2:1-11 explain what it takes for us to gain that kind of spiritual insight and wisdom?

1. How might putting the following verses into action add to how we can know God better?

    Psalm 139:23-24

    Hebrews 10:24-25

1. As followers of Jesus, we have the hope that we will be with God in eternity and that we can help others do the same. How do the following verses affirm the hope we have here on earth as we live our lives for Jesus?

    Philippians 1:6

    2 Corinthians 4:16-17

    2 Corinthians 5:17
