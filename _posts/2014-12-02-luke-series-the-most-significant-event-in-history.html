<h2><strong>LifeGroup Study</strong></h2>
<p>Ice-breaker: What is your favorite Christmas Movie?</p>
<p>Looking back at your notes from this week’s teaching, was there anything that particularly caught your attention, challenged or confused you?</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you ever engaged in a conversation with someone regarding whether the resurrection really happened? If so, how did it go?</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Studies show 64% of Americans believe the resurrection to be true according to a 2013 poll. In light of this, why do you think so many choose not to follow Christ or live like this is true?</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Understanding who Jesus is and what he has done for us is the essential message of the resurrection. The following passages all contain statements that Jesus made about himself. For each one, identify what he says about himself and any ways you can think of how his description of himself can impact our lives as believers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Matthew 11:29</p>
<p>John 6:35</p>
<p>John 8:12</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>John 10:14-15</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>John 14:6</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which of the descriptions of Jesus catches your attention the most and why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>When someone decides to live in light of the reality of the resurrection, there is a cost involved, because anything worth much usually costs much. How do Jesus’ words about the cost of following him in Luke 14:25-35 fit with your spiritual journey and/or experience in following him?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>In reality, living out your faith is the best proof of a resurrected Jesus. This is described in the Bible as being the “hands and feet of Jesus.” How do the following verses reinforce this idea and describe what this looks like?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matthew 5:13-16</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 Peter 2:15-17</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Philippians 2:1-5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which of these verses powers you the most to live like Jesus?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
