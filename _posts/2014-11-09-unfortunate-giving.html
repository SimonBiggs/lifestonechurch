<h2>LifeGroup Study</h2>
<p>What is your favorite season of the year and why?</p>
<p>Looking back at your notes from this Sunday's teaching, was there a particular point, verse, or comment that caught your attention, challenged you, or raised a question?</p>
<p>1. There are over 30 "one another" commands in the New Testament that are hard or nearly impossible to fulfill in a large group setting or by yourself. Here are a few of them. After reading each verse below, identify the "one another command in each one.</p>
<p>John 13:34-35</p>
<p>Romans 12:10, 12:16, 14:13, 15:7, 15:14</p>
<p>Colossians 12:25</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 12:25</p>
<p>Galatians 5:13</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:32, 5:21</p>
<p>Colossians 3:9</p>
<p>1 Thessalonians 5:15</p>
<p>Hebrews 3:13, 10:24-25</p>
<p>James 4:11, 5:16</p>
<p>2. These "one another" commands are best carried out within the framework of a church or group that is small enough for close and accountable relationships. Are there any steps you need to take to develop these kinds of relationships in your own life? Is joining a LifeGroup a good step for you?</p>
<p>3. of the key ingredients for spiritual growth is the Holy Spirit. A potential hindrance to His power and motivation working in our lives is the sinful and self-centered nature we are all born with. Galations 5:16-26 describes the conflict between the two.</p>
<p>Galations 5:16-26</p>
