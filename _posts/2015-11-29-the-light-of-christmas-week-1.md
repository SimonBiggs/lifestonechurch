## LifeGroup Discussion Questions

Why is loneliness sometimes magnified during Christmas?

1. Does it seem a bigger problem today than in the recent past? Why or why not? Read Psalm 68:5-6; Hebrews 13:5 - What do these verses say to you?

2. When we feel alone and isolated from others, we are an easy target for the devil. Read John 8:44 - How does Satan operate and why would he want to make us feel lonely? What advice do we get in James 4:7 to deal with these attacks and vulnerability.

3. How can focusing on meeting other people's needs help a person's struggle with loneliness? Read John 15:13, and Philippians 2:3-7 - How do these verses address loneliness?

4. Why is it also important to open up your life to others to build meaningful relationships? What do you think "open up your life to others" entails?

5. Why are people sometimes lonely even if they have a church home? Read Acts 2:42, John 17:23 - How do these verses give us a picture of God's desire for local church families?
