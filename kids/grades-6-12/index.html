<p>We exist to encourage and partner with the parents of Jr./Sr. High students to help guide kids through their spiritual journey.  Our desire is to see students empowered with the message of the gospel so that they find their identity and security in Christ alone.  We meet every Wednesday night to build up and encourage one another with a biblical message so our students can stand firm in their faith and be leaders on our campuses and in our neighborhoods and…. just because its fun!!!  On Sunday mornings the Jr. High &amp; Sr. High students attend church with their parents.</p>

<h2>Summer Camp</h2>

<p>We finally have all the <a href="/assets/uploads/pages/summerCamp.pdf">details</a> ready for camp and boy are we excited!</p>

<p>This summer we will be taking our students to Big Canyon Ranch for the most exciting week of their year.  The kids will be staying in cabins/yurts as they spend the week having fun with water games, hiking, and obstacle courses.  Each night will conclude with an awesome worship band and an engaging biblical message.  This is an important time for our students to get away and connect with other Christian students as they dive deeper into the bible and their relationship with Christ.  As a church we deeply believe that each student will come back changed and want to ensure everyone has the opportunity to come with us.</p>

<p>Last year we took some students to this camp for the first time and everyone came back in awe of all that the Lord did during the week and the beauty of the mountain retreat where Big Canyon Ranch is located. This year as we prepared to return to this amazing camp we were delayed in getting details of dates and costs. As a result of how important we think camp is and getting the information out late Lifestone Church is paying half of the total cost of camp for each student this year.  Camp is a great launching pad for your student's spiritual growth and we want to see all of our kids attend.</p>
