<p>When you’re visiting a church for the first time, there can sometimes be some unknowns. You might be asking, “Where do I go? Where do my kids go? What will the music be like? What will people be wearing? What will the teaching be like? What time will I get out for lunch?”</p>

<p>These are all valid questions to ask when you visit a new church. Below you will find some helpful information on what to expect when you arrive at a Lifestone Church service. We want your visit to feel as comfortable as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Dress:</strong> Dress comfortably. You’ll feel right at home wearing anything from shorts, to jeans, to business casual.</p>

<p><strong>Time frame:</strong> Our services are on Sunday mornings from 10:30-11:30.We recommend arriving about 10-15 minutes early so that you can get your kids checked in and grab some donuts and coffee before the worship service begins.</p>

<p><strong>Arriving:</strong> Inside, a Lifestone volunteer will greet you and answer any questions you have about finding Kids Life area, worship area, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Kid’s Life:</strong> We encourage you to bring your kiddos (infants through 5th graders) to participate in our fun, safe, kid-friendly activities while you attend the adult service. Kids are very important to us here at Lifestone, and our goal is to teach them about Jesus’ love in a way that they will understand and enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>Breakfast:</strong> For your convenience, a simple breakfast with donuts, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate will be set up for you outside the worship area.</p>

<p><strong>Music:</strong> Come enjoy contemporary praise songs as well as some old hymns with modern arrangements.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching:</strong> Be encouraged by biblical teaching that is useful in every day living.</p>
